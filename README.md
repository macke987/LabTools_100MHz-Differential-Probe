## Progress status

 - [x] have a [need](#why)
 - [x] define the technical [specifications](#Input-specifications)
 - [x] decide on what is should [look](#how) like
 - [ ] create drawings for the [housing](#mechanical-construction)
 - [ ] [test and validate](#Demo-setup-and-measurements) the concept
 - [ ] publish the [schematic and explain the electronics](#Electronics)
 - [x] publish production files for the [electronics board](#Printed-circuit-board) board
 - [ ] write [end-user documentation](https://github.com/nostradomus/100MHz+_Differential_Probe/wiki)

## Technical details

### Input specifications

- (over) 100MHz off bandwith
- 100kÎ© input resistance
- max 700Vpp or 2500Vpp (depending on C1,C2)

### Mechanical construction

The bases for the housing is an abs handheld instrument enclosure from the [1593 series](https://www.hammfg.com/electronics/small-case/plastic/1593), fabricated by [Hammond manufacturing](https://www.hammfg.com/), more specifically [1593LGY](pdf-files/) (grey-coloured, with two removable end-plates).

The pcb for the probe has been designed in such a way that it can be fixed with four screws to the bottom of the enclosure. On the side of the pcb, cut-outs have been foreseen for the holes that allow to screw the bottom and top of the enclosure together. The large rectangle cut-out fits a [9V block battery](pdf-files/datasheet_-_9v-alkaline.pdf) which serves as power supply for the probe. A T-shaped groove on the input-side protects the circuitry from arcing  and creep when higher input voltages are applied (please implement all safety precautions as explained in the [electronics](#Electronics) and [building](#Building-instructions) paragraphs when working with potential differences which are higher than 48V-to-earth).
